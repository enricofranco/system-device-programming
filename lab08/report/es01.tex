\section*{Exercise 1}

The goal of the proposed program is to copy a file, with name given on \texttt{argv[1]}, on a file with name given on \texttt{argv[2]}.

Three syntax errors were discovered by Visual Studio on line 21: \\
\texttt{fprint("Cannot open input file. Error: \%x \textbackslash n", GetLastError());} \\
because the call does not match the \texttt{fprintf} prototype. It is needed to insert a \texttt{FILE*} argument, i.e.\@ \texttt{stderr} in this case, as first argument. This will solve all three syntax errors.

Bug is on line 34.: \\
\texttt{WriteFile(hOut, buffer, BUF\_SIZE, \&nOut, NULL);} which should always write \texttt{\textbf{BUF\_SIZE}} bytes in the output file. This is wrong because only \texttt{nIn} bytes, i.e.\@ the ones read before, can be written. Replacing \texttt{BUF\_SIZE} with \texttt{nIn} will solve the problem.
