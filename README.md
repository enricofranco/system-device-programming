# System and device programming
This repository contains the solution of the exercises assigned during the lab sessions of the "System and device programming" course taught at Politecnico di Torino by professor Laface Pietro. Academic Year 2017-2018.
Each laboratory should contain some exercises, each one with an attached report written in LaTeX to better explain my solving algorithm and the adopted strategy.
